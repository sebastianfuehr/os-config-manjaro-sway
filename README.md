# Personal Manjaro Sway Configurations

Collection of my personal configuration files.

## Pull Configurations

To pull the current configurations into this repository I use the `pull.sh` script. Make executable via `chmod +x pull.sh`, then execute via `./pull.sh`.

## Push Configurations

Same as pull, just use `push.sh`.
